      %h2#overview Overview
      %p In the words of John Hunter, the World Peace Game (WPG) is a teaching tool: 
      %p "It is not an entertainment or a diversion for idle minds, because its main purpose is really as a teaching vehicle: helping kids to develop conceptual plans, design and implement them, push innovative and creative thinking, help them to formulate ideas and be able to express them concisely and persuasively, to be able to ‘deal‘ with adults on equal footing in conversation and to the extent possible conceptually and philosophically, to foster regular reflective practice, and of course, to foster compassion."
      %p Your students will already be using the game to learn the larger concepts that John just pointed out. The WPG is truly incredible, however, because the game also gives you freedom to integrate core curriculum requirements. Think of the game as scaffolding for the teaching objectives that you have. Through play students achieve these objectives in a measurable way. 
      %p Students learn to
      %ul
        %li Communicate, negotiate, and compromise
        %li Make decisions under pressure
        %li Set, enforce, and comply with standards of online behavior
        %li Balance multiple conflicts and motivations
        %li Chunk a larger problem into manageable pieces
      %p Students take on roles as leaders in countries of various wealth, members of the World Bank, Arms Dealers, and various other positions. Each game day, countries take turns making declarations, followed by a period for negotiation after each declaration. The World Peace Game is played by constant discussion and negotiation. The game is won when the countries have worked to solve a list of crisis and every country has a net gain.

      %h2#crises Crises
      %h4 Border Land Dispute
      %p A’s southernmost island ownership is in dispute with B.  B claims that, long ago, the Queen of A gave the land over to B, but the treaty has been lost.  B also wants the island for further oil production.  A is afraid that B simply wants to take over their country and this is just the beginning.
      %p B has launched a military strike on the southernmost island of A, sending regular army and mercenary troops there.  An attack has been launched and two aircraft from B are also headed to the island along with ships.  The UN based nearby is trying to create a barrier between the two.
      %h4 Air Defense Scramble
      %p A has started a counter-attack, and is sending its antiquated air force to the battle and ships to match.  Also it appears that accidentally some of their ships stray into the territorial waters of C.  C immediately issues a warning; saying that it fears A is trying a sneak attack on C.  C sends a squadron of aircraft towards A as a defensive move.
      %h4 Natural Disaster
      %p Suddenly A has a volcanic eruption!  A has two game days to evacuate resources and troops from the southern end of the country or lose them all!
      %h4 Rebel Insurgency
      %p Suddenly, ethnic (The Kajaz) troops within B take over a critical oil refinery and oil reserves field! They threaten to destroy the refinery complex if challenged.  The Kajaz want to establish a religious homeland for themselves (note area).  They immediately offer to sell oil to A (an oil-poor country – oil would arrive in one game day!) and also seek its alliance in defeating B.  The Kajaz Tribal leader is the MOD of B!
      %h4 Religious Tensions
      %p Relations and trade between D and C are in jeopardy.  C owns the sacred island that D treats as its own, as the D ethnic minority, the Nins, have worshipped for thousands of years.  D had been allowed by C to use it, according to an ancient treaty, “forever”.  But C wants to start charging a “usage fee” of 10 million per day for the use of the island (to pay for its Space Station Project).
      %p D cannot spare that kind of money and refuses, but insists it will continue to use the island.  A mysterious explosion just occurs there, near the most holy of D shrines!  D immediately sends three thousand troops onto the bridge towards C (securing it), and also a squadron of jet fighters through the gulf toward C.  Both countries go to yellow alert!
      %h4 Endangered Species
      %p Oil has just been discovered on a remote northern, ice-covered island off the coast of A, which feels it desperately needs the revenues oil would bring, to combat B’s advances.  D, an ecologically dedicated nation, is determined to preserve the ecology there because of a rare endangered (microscopic) life form and because it is so close to D and the drilling may threaten their own environment as well!  D’s fleet quickly surrounds the island to keep the oil from being drilled by anyone, also sending two jet fighters over the island, which violates A’s airspace!
      %p A re-states its ownership, lodges a complaint with the UN, and also sets up an attack helicopter fire base on the island to protect the oil drilling operation. (It would take three game days to drill, and then get revenue for drilling – coin toss determines if drill is successful).  Suddenly C offers to buy it from A, though no one is sure if it is indeed owned by A.  The UN actually cannot find a record of the rightful ownership of the disputed land.  What will the UN do?  How will it decide who owns the land?
      %h4 Drone Attacks
      %p Country C is believed by many to have drone attack aircraft flying missions over the border of the Secret Empire and C, and possibly over other countries as well.  The Secret Empire has just threatened to attack C with nuclear weapons if the drones aren’t removed immediately.  No one knows if the Secret Empire has nukes, but all do know that the Secret Empire has a nuclear development program and in a matter of 3-4 game days may have the ability to arm and fire nuclear weapons!  What will C do?  Suddenly there is a drone crash on the border between the Secret Empire and D!  A group of cyber hackers called itself the Free Empire Leaks claims responsibility for crashing the drone.  They also release pages of secret communications between the Nins and the Kajaz, which imply that the former king of Kajaz and the last Nin leader were planning on joining with the Secret Empire to make a new state for purposes unknown.  What will happen?
      %h4 Territorial Ownership Dispute
      %p A forgotten oil storage depot is discovered on an unclaimed island off the coast of C.  C’s former Secretary of State, Mohammed Seward had sold it to A 10 years ago, thinking it was worthless.  Now it is called “Seward’s Folly”, as it is worth more than $250 billion!  C wants to void that original sale and reclaim the land and presents a newly “discovered” document stating that the island originally belonged to C “always and forever”.  A says “sorry”, all sales are final!
      %p A and C both insist that the UN back its claim!  Without waiting for the UN, C begins sending ships to transport the oil home now!  Four ships: two cargo and two destroyers plus 3,000 troops were sent to the island.  But then, an independent team of archaeologists find an aincent burial ground with bones and DNA matching Nin and Secret Empire peoples!  The NINs want to investigate to see if this is another Nin ancestor burial ground, which if found to be true, they would claim the land as their own.  The Secret Empire doesn’t need any scientific evidence!  It says the land is 100% its own, and prepares to send troops to take it over!
      %h4 Oil Embargo
      %p B places an immediate oil shipment and trade embargo on C.  C is insulted and not to be bullied by this, moves eight thousand troops toward the bridge between the two countries, with a squadron of fighters over the B offshore oilrigs in their common bay.  B responds by shelling C border resort towns (prudently evacuated by C – no casualties so far) and sending three tank divisions over the bridge toward C territory, and three Mig fighters over the gulf between the two countries AND lands 15,000 invasion force paratroops on C soil.  C threatens to use its nuclear arsenal!
      %h4 Arms Proliferation
      %p B races to begin its own nuclear arms weapons program (in three game days at $50 billion).  Tourist industry of both (B and C) countries loses $50 million each, per day of conflict (from Oil Embargo).
      %p Arms dealers offer cut-rates and discounts 20% off, on all weapons; and will offer uranium-enriching technology for small-scale “dirty” bombs, privately only!  You know what that means!

      %h4 Territorial Waters Dispute
      %p A’s ships appear to violate the territorial waters and rich fishing grounds of C.  C insists A’s ships leave immediately.  A begs for just three more game days to finish its fishing catch.  Its people need the food.  Just three days!  It followed the school from open water there by accident, it says.  C says “Enough!” and prepares to launch a punishing air strike on A’s mainland.  B says if C ships stay in that area one more day, it will attack C’s mainland too!  B now claims that the trespass into territorial waters is merely a ruse and that C and A together are indeed trying to deceive B for a sneak attack.  B prepares to fight both.
      %h4 Forced Alliance
      %p B, not rich in other resources but has a long-standing deal to sell oil to D who has always agreed to then supply B with much of its other resource needs (materials, factories, etc.).  B now insists that D join B (demands an answer in one game day or else!) in a military campaign against C AND A, and wants D to also attack A from the north to create an infantry “hammer and anvil” crushing maneuver on A.
      %p B also sends two fighter squadrons and six warships toward the northern A island to prepare for the campaign.
      %p C, aware of the B request to D, insists that D sever all ties with B until the crisis is settled!  D refuses, not wishing to anger its only oil and weapons supplier and major trading partner, B.
      %h4 Global Warming (1)
      %p Some scientists trace Global warming to the pollution of the major industrial powers, B and C.  It causes major fish migration from the territorial waters of A into B’s waters.  A had fishing as its major income and stands to lose $75 million per game day now!  It demands financial compensation of $75 million + $25 million in penalties from B and C by lodging a complaint with the UN.  A needs the money NOW, within two game days.  Its people are starving!  It will begin to lose 1000 people a day to hunger after two days.
      %h4 Global Warming (2)
      %p There can be a Hydrogen Fuel Cell Technology breakthrough by A scientists.  If achieved, (determined by a 2/3 coin toss per game day).  The technology can be used to save A.  If used by other countries, the entire world can survive.  If not, only A will survive and prosper while other countries will lose 10% of their land mass and resources per day!  This loss starts after five game days if global warming is not stopped or reversed!
      %p Only A can license this technology.  One license (Hydrogen Plant) costs $15 billion per plant.  Fifteen plants per country are required to stop global warming!  Global Melt will occur in seven game days!  What else can be done?  Weather goddess determines effectiveness of proposed solutions.
      %h4 Ethnic Cleansing
      %p C has banished the Krell people, an ethnic minority from its homeland.  The Krell are expelled to D, who takes the refugees in (They are distantly related to the Nins).  Suddenly, the very next day, a “Waters of Life” or WOL, a magical spring, is discovered on the banished Krell people’s old land.  It can reverse disease and prolong life by 60 years!  Do the Krell no longer own it?  It can the extend life of ailing PM/Secretary of State of C who maybe (random goddess decides) has ___ days to live unless he or she receives the WOL!
      %h4 Mercenaries and Rogue Military
      %p Mysterious, unidentified mercenary troops suddenly land on the island owned by C, and launch several attacks against the D/Nin troops garrisoned there.  (This land is used by the ethnic minority of Nins of D.)  Who are the mercenaries fighting for? C? A? B? Secret Empire? The Krell? The Kajazians?
      %p The mercenaries take half the island and D’s ethnic minority Nins are going crazy, demanding that its government defeat and remove mercenaries IMMEDIATELY, or they will overthrow and replace the PM with the Secretary of State’s (and ethnic Nin) opposition party!  One game day or else!
      %h4 Ecological Disaster
      %p An oil spill occurs off the southeastern coast of C in its territorial fishing waters.  C charges that ships from B intentionally released the oil and demands cleanup and compensation for lost fishing harvest ($200 Million).  If the oil slick hits C’s coast (2 game days), it will cost $20 million in ecological disaster cleanup per day until it is cleaned up (requires 3 game days to clean).
      %h4 Toxic Chemical Spill
      %p A toxic chemical spill heads downstream on the major river in C to the common bay between C and D (and the Nin holy land!).  Farmers along the river lose $10 million per day until the wastes pass in 5 game days.  Clean water is desperately needed by farmers.  Lots of water in D, a Land ofMany Lakes type of country.  Nins are upset, D is upset as the toxic chemicals will violate international pollution laws and foul their pristine lakes eventually.  Losses will be $100 million.  Clean up may begin at any time to head off losses, but will cost $50 million.  Who will pay?
      %h4 SPACE: Star Wars Missile Defense
      %p A C reconnaissance satellite malfunctions, strays off course (so C claims) over D’s sacred island.  The Nins are incensed and immediately declare a holy war on C, despite the call for calm by the D PM.  The Nins have $500 million in cash but need arms.  B has launched its own killer satellite (a Star Wars Laserfire type), which becomes operational in three game days.  It would be able to fire on and defeat one entire city per game day, if used!  Remaining cost to make each operational is $150 billion.  The UN issues a condemnation and asks the World Bank to freeze the $150 billion B had asked the World Bank to loan their country.  Will B use domestic funds to complete the project?
      %p Collision course is set by C to ram its 3 satellite telescopes into the B “killer” satellite.  Impact in two game days, unless satellites are re-tasked/rerouted by C.
      %p C has been asteroid mining and finds 2 of its ships issuing mayday distress calls as both are trapped on the edge of a singularity, a black hole.  International Space Law requires any ship nearby to render aid to any other ship in distress, no matter the nationality or relations between nations on the ground ($10 billion fine for failure to comply).  B ships (carrying rescue equipment) have been mining in a nearby field, which will drift away from this quadrant in two game days.  B commanders radio home for instructions.  No ships carry weapons.
      %h4 Undersea: Mining
      %p A owns and operates ½ of the undersea mining sites discovered so far (1/1 coin toss determines daily find; revenue $5 million each time a toss is won).  C owns the other ½ of the sites.  Both nations send subs racing toward the other’s territorial waters and sites over…
      %h4 Undersea: Sunken Civilization Artifacts
      %p Ancient ruins discovered undersea partly in international waters, and partly in A’s territorial waters.  Submarines have recovered two artifacts from the city with a faded script etched on pottery shards.  One shard has an ancient language that seems part-Krell, and part C.  The other artifact has an unknown language on it, but has a single letter on its side from an ancient alphabet from what appears to be a Nin-Kajazian tongue! The sub crew also estimates that the treasure yet to be found may be worth tens of billions!
      %p D petitions the UN to declare the site an ecological protectorate and to seal the site and leave it undisturbed ever, as an endangered species has its spawning ground just above the sunken city.  Who owns it?  What will the UN do?
      %h4 Cyber-Hacking
      %p A’s military command and control computer networks are hacked into by an unknown party.  Files are destroyed and A’s whaling fleet’s annual whale catch is disrupted so that A will lose at least $50 million!  Who are the hackers?  Can they strike again?  Who else is at risk and vulnerable?  Cost to repair A’s network firewalls is $25 million.  Cost to upgrade security and encryption is an additional $60 million.  Will it work?
      %h4 Ancestor Burial Dilemma
      %p Another independent team of archeologists has unearthed an ancient burial ground in the mountains, gold-rich, northern province of C, and DNA-tested the bones to find Nin genomes – the bones of Nin ancestors there!
      %p This time, the Nin Tribal Leader immediately orders two thousand troops on the site, and a Nin field commander marks off a large area of the territory around the bones, and declaring it a “Nin homeland”; as Nin custom does not under any circumstances allow for removal or disturbance of ancestral remains.  The Nins petition the UN to rule and declare this land as an official new state, “Nintain” and award ownership to the NIns within two game days.  The Nins say they will never leave.  Gold cannot be excavated without disturbing the remains.
      %p C had issued an ultimatum: Nins must go in two game days or face military action! (Gold mining and removal would take at least 30 game days.) Suddenly the fast retreating archeologists report that their DNA test also show traces of Kajazian DNA in the bones too! What does this mean?
      %h4 Oil Well Gusher Blow-Out
      %p An oil rig in the Middle sea owned by B has exploded!  60,000 barrels of oil per day is gushing into the ocean (the weather goddess decides which way the wind and currents carry it.)  The oil travels 500 kilometers in two game days.  Cost to B per day is $60 million!
      %p A cap is lowered onto the well and is funneling some of the oil onto a relief ship.  A coin toss by B each game day may determine how much oil is captured.  A 2/3 coin toss win means 20,000 barrels are captured (reducing the daily costs to B).  Will the UN call for B to pay for environmental damages?  If so, how much?
      %p If B fails to cap the well, the entire coasts of A and D will be fouled and each country will lose one half billion dollars per day for the rest of the game!
