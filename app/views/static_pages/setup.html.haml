      / Number of players
      %h3 Number of players
      %p Minimum players: 22 (4 per country, 1 each of World Bank, Arms Dealers, Weather Goddess, UN representative, Media). We feel this is the bare minimum of players necessary to have an engaging game full of conflict and communication. The game will feel slightly different.
      %p Recommended: 27-33 (5 per country, 1 WG, 3 of the other roles)
      %p Maximum: 37 (5 per country, 1 WG, 4 of other roles) Once you have more than 4 players in the UN, World Bank, Arms Dealers, and Media, there are simply not enough countries to accommodate actions for all the players.
